# Resume Version Control Integration

## Overview

This document explains the integration of the Resume Version Control (RVC) functionality into the JobJedi application. RVC was originally developed as a separate project to provide version control for resumes based on job descriptions. It has now been fully integrated into JobJedi to provide a seamless experience for users managing both job applications and optimized resumes.

## Integration Details

### Original RVC Architecture

The original RVC project was built with:
- **Backend**: Python/FastAPI
- **Database**: AWS DynamoDB
- **Search Algorithm**: TF-IDF based document similarity

### Integrated Architecture

The RVC functionality has been integrated into JobJedi using:
- **Backend**: TypeScript/Node.js with Express (matching JobJedi's existing stack)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (same database as JobJedi, new table)
- **Search Algorithm**: TF-IDF ported from Python to TypeScript

## Components

### Backend

1. **Models**
   - `Resume` entity in TypeORM for database interactions
   - Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) for API interactions

2. **Services**
   - `TFIDFService` for resume-job matching using text similarity

3. **Controllers & Routes**
   - CRUD operations for resumes
   - Search functionality based on job descriptions

### Frontend

1. **Pages**
   - `/resumes` - A dedicated page for managing and searching resumes

2. **Components**
   - Resume creation form
   - Resume search interface
   - Resume list and management

3. **Services**
   - API client for resume operations

## Database Schema

A new `resumes` table has been added to the existing JobJedi PostgreSQL database with the following structure:

```sql
CREATE TABLE resumes (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  jdText TEXT NOT NULL,
  resumeText TEXT NOT NULL,
  alias VARCHAR,
  userId VARCHAR NOT NULL,
  createdAt TIMESTAMP DEFAULT now(),
  updatedAt TIMESTAMP DEFAULT now(),
  
  -- Indexes
  INDEX IDX_RESUMES_USER_ID (userId),
  UNIQUE INDEX IDX_RESUMES_USER_ALIAS (userId, alias) WHERE alias IS NOT NULL
);
```

## Features

### Resume Management

- Create new resumes with associated job descriptions
- Assign optional aliases for easy identification
- View all stored resumes
- Delete unwanted resumes

### Resume Search

- Search for the most relevant resume given a job description
- Results are ranked by similarity score
- View excerpts of matching resumes

## Usage

### Adding a New Resume

1. Navigate to the Resumes page
2. Fill in the job description and your resume text
3. Optionally provide an alias for easy reference
4. Click "Save Resume"

### Finding the Best Resume for a Job

1. Navigate to the Resumes page
2. In the search section, paste the job description
3. Click "Search"
4. Review the results, sorted by match quality

## Authentication

The resume functionality uses the same authentication system as the rest of JobJedi. For development purposes, a simple middleware is provided that uses the `userEmail` parameter to identify users.

## Future Enhancements

1. **S3 Integration**: Store full resume documents in S3 instead of just text in the database
2. **Enhanced TF-IDF**: Improve similarity algorithm with additional NLP techniques
3. **Resume Versions**: Track changes to resumes over time
4. **Resume Analytics**: Provide insights into resume effectiveness

## Migration Notes

The original RVC project used DynamoDB with a different data model. The integration process required:

1. Creating a new database schema compatible with PostgreSQL and TypeORM
2. Porting the TF-IDF implementation from Python to TypeScript
3. Adapting the API routes to match JobJedi's patterns
4. Creating a new frontend using Next.js instead of the original React implementation

## Conclusion

The integration of RVC into JobJedi enhances the platform's capabilities by allowing users to manage and optimize their resumes in the context of their job search. By bringing these features into a single application, users can now maintain a comprehensive job search workflow from a single interface.
